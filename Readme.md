# Welcome to the Internet

## Introduction

In today's lessons we learned about how the Internet works and the basics about how to set up a website. In this lab we are going to review some of the most important concepts in today's lesson.

## Requirements

- [Learn how to fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `code/labs` folder

## Iteration 1

Edit this file to write the answers to the following questions.

- What does HTTP stand for?
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- Which protocol is used to resolve a domain name to an IP address?
DNS (Domanin Name System)
- What are the HTTP status codes?
They are signals that shows how the HTTP response was.
- What are the different main types of HTTP status codes?
1xx Informational
2xx Success
3xx Redirection
4xx Client Error
5xx Server Error

## Iteration 2

Use what we have learned in today's lesson and research the Internet to answer True or False to these questions. Explain your answer.
- T/F: HTTP headers can be changed by a user before executing a request.
T
- T/F: Every HTTP request has a domain and a path.
T
- T/F: Email clients use the HTTP Protocol.
F

## Iteration 3

In this iteration we are going to practise how to deploy your website on a hosting provider.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/) is a cloud-based hosting provider that allows clients to deploy small website for free, so it is perfect for small prototypes or non-commercial projects.

This is a good chance to refresh your HTML and CSS knowledge! Create a small webpage in HTML and CSS with a heading, a footer and a centered image in the middle, then style the page.

Once you are done, create a GitHub repository and sync your website.

## Iteration 4

Follow these steps to deploy your website to Netlify:

1. Create a free account in Netlify using your GitHub account and Log In.
2. Click on **Add new site**.
3. Click on **Import an existing project** and select **GitHub**.
4. Follow the steps to authorize Netlify to access your repo.
5. Select the repo with the webpage you created on Iteration 3.
6. The steps to follow on the setting pages depend on the project being deployed. For static pages like this one set the directory to `/` and leave the build command blank. Click on **Deploy site**.

With this you should have the page deployed and working on a random Netlify domain.

## Bonus

1. Change the domain name to your own name.
NOTE: All free netlify domains end in `.netlify.app`

2. Netlify also works as a Domain Name Registry service. Try to find where to edit the Domain Name Records Table.

## Deliverables

This README.md file edited to include the query or queries needed to solve each question.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Then create a Pull Request!!
